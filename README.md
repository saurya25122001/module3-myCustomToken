# module3-myCustomToken
This repository is made for my ethereum beginner project which is used to create MY TOKEN using contracts

## Problem Statement
write a smart contract to create your own token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you should be able to interact with it.the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Description
MyCustomToken is a custom Ethereum token contract that allows you to create and deploy your own ERC20-compliant token. The contract is designed to provide basic token functionality, including the ability for the contract owner to mint new tokens to provided addresses and for users to burn and transfer tokens.

## Features

- **Minting Tokens**: The contract owner has the exclusive ability to mint new tokens and allocate them to any provided address.
- **Burning Tokens**: Any user can burn (destroy) their own tokens, effectively reducing the total supply.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Users can transfer tokens from their address to another user's address.
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: The contract adheres to the ERC20 standard, making it compatible with various Ethereum wallets and services.


## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at (https://remix.ethereum.org/.)

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., error.sol). Copy and paste the following code written by me into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set heigher to "0.8.1" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile error.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken1" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by passing the address. call any of the three function and set the value, and you can burn, mint or check the balance of your NFT.
